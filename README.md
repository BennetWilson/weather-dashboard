# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My task

For this homework, I was to use Open Weather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities so that I could display today's weather and a 5 day forecast in a specified city.

## Description

I started by trying to create an HTMl layout so I could wrap my head around how I wanted this to work.

I restarted several times and finally found a way to create the layout I was looking for, and left it as is.

I found that a modern-looking and minimalistic style suited this application best.

I then created three JS files as I found it easier for me to understand if all of the parts were separated.


My application can display today's weather and infomation such as; High and Low temperatures, Humidity, Wind Speed, Current Temperature, UV Index and Weather Description.

My application displays a five-day forecast for the location. This forecast includes; High and Low temperatures, Humidity, Wind Speed, Current Temperature, UV Index and Weather Description.
