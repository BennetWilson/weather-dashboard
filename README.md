# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My task

For this homework, I was to use Open Weather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities so that I could display today's weather and a 5 day forecast in a specified city.

## Description

I started by trying to create an HTMl layout so I could wrap my head around how I wanted this to work.

I restarted several times and finally found a way to create the layout I was looking for, and left it as is.

I found that a modern-looking and minimalistic style suited this application best.

I then created three JS files as I found it easier for me to understand if all of the parts were separated.

Fetch.js is where my fetch is.

Data.js is where my data should go to after the fetch has been completed. I included my event listeners and some of the basic logic. This is also where I would have included my local storage.

UI.js is where I put everything together using innerHTML.

My application can display today's weather and some infomation such as; High and Low temperatures, humidity, wind speed and current temperature. I was not able to figure out how to get the UV index.

I was also not able to get a five day forecast, although I would like to rectify this in the future when I learn more and become more comfortable with API's.
